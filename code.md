3. Create a usability test case to evaluate the user-friendliness of a particular interface feature. Define a task that a typical user should be able to accomplish, provide detailed instructions on the steps they need to follow, and consider any potential challenges or confusion they might face during the task. Clearly indicate the expected level of ease of use or difficulties.

4. Create an accessibility test case to evaluate the software's compliance with accessibility standards. Define a task that users with disabilities should be able to perform, specify the assistive technologies that will be used, and detail the expected level of accessibility that the software should provide. Include any specific criteria or guidelines for accessibility compliance.
